# stumbly

Exploring reinforcment learning, specifically q function approximation with a two (or more!) layer neural network and hill climbing algorithms. 

All to help stumbly (or your very own creature) learn to walk! :-)

Includes:
A quick and dirty creature creator/editor using pybox2d for physics and pygame for rendering. Checkout the notebooks to see how to run everything.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZbVM4TP0IY) of the creature creator.

You need these things to run it all:

[jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

[pygame](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)

[pybox2d](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d)

[numpy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)

[scipy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)

Happy to hear any improvements/suggestions.

Unfortunately there seems to be some issues with pygame and mouse input on Mac OS X El Capitan. I've only tested this project on Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04.
