# stumbly

Exploring reinforcment learning in a physics environment.

All to help stumbly (or your very own creature) learn to walk! :-)

Includes:
A quick and dirty creature creator/editor using pybox2d for physics and pyglet for rendering. Checkout the two notebooks.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZbVM4TP0IY) of the creature creator.
And some [learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgQcg9Zl5Y8)

You need these things to run it all:

Python 3.4

[jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

[pybox2d](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d)

[pyglet](http://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.2-maintenance/programming_guide/installation.html)

[numpy](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)


Happy to hear any improvements/suggestions!

Thanks for stopping by.
