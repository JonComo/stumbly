# stumbly

Exploring reinforcment learning, specifically q function approximation with a two (or more!) layer neural network.

All to help stumbly learn to walk! :-)

Includes:
A quick and dirty creature creator/editor using pybox2d for physics and pygame for rendering. Checkout the notebooks to see how to run everything. I'm currently adding back in the RL code, was cleaning up editor and engine code.


You need jupyter notebook, numpy, pygame and pybox2d to run.

jupyter notebook: http://jupyter.org/

pygame: http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

pybox2d: https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d

numpy: http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html

Happy to hear any improvements/suggestions.
